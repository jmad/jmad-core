/**
 * The JACOBIAN command minimises the penalty function calculating the Jacobian and solving the linear problem. A QR or
 * LQ decomposition is performed when the system is over or under-determined. Before starting the matching routine two
 * optional transformations (COOL and RANDOM) are performed.
 * JACOBIAN,CALLS=integer,TOLERANCE=real,REPEAT=integer,STRATEGY=integer,COOL= real,BALANCE=real, random=real; The
 * command has the attributes: CALLS: The maximum number of calls to the penalty function (default: 30). TOLERANCE: The
 * desired tolerance for the minimum (default: 10**(-6)). REPEAT: The number of call of the JACOBIAN routine (default:
 * 1). BISEC: Selects the maximum number of iteratation used to determin the step length which reduces the penalty
 * function during the main iteration. A large number (i.e. 6) reduce the probability to diverge from the solution, but
 * increase the one for being trapped in a local minum. STRATEGY: A code for the strategy to be used (default: 3). If
 * STRATEGY=1 the routine resets the values of the variables which exceeds the limits. If STRATEGY=2 the routine print
 * the Jacobian and exit without matching. If STRATEGY=3 the routine disables the variables which exceeds the limits
 * keeping however the number of variables greater or equal to the number of the constraints. COOL, BALANCE: The factors
 * which specify the following transformation:
 * {@literal if "balance" >=0 newval=(1-cool)*oldval+cool*((1-balance)*maxval+balance*minval )
 * else newval=(1-cool)*oldval+cool* optval }
 * where newval is the new value after the transformation, oldval is the previous value, maxval, minval,
 * optval are the maximum value, minimum value, optimal
 * value of the variable specified in the VARY command. RANDOM: The factors which specify the following transformation:
 * newval= (1+ random * rand() ) * oldval where newval is the new value after the transformation, oldval is the previous
 * value, rand() is a stochastic variable with a uniform (-0.5,0.5) distribution. Example:
 * JACOBIAN,CALLS=20,TOLERANCE=1.0E-8,STRATEGY= 3,COOL=0.1,BALANCE=0.5,RANDOM=0.01;
